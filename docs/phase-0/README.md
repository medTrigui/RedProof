# Phase 0 Deliverables

- `schema.md` – human-readable view of the `.red` artifact and how it maps to Rust types.
- `threat-model.md` – assets, actors, mitigations, and residual risks.
- `glossary.md` – shared vocabulary for later contributors.
- `cli-ux.md` – CLI expectations that downstream work must satisfy.
- `../ROADMAP.md` – master milestone tracker (kept in sync with phase docs).

Use this folder to track discussion notes and deltas discovered during implementation.
